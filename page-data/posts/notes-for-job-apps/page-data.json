The position was of an undeterminate type, and they were hiring for a general placement in their teams later. The interviews were segreggated into 3 segments; a technical interview, a collaborative interview, and an interview with the hiring manager. </p>\n<p>According to my own personal post-interview review, as well as feedback from the recruiter, Tristan, who had reached out to me, my technical interview was weak and the other (more social/personality-based) interviewers indicated that I didn’t fit their criteria well. </p>\n<p>Some points to take away:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The interviewers are looking for some prerequisite technical knowledge, but also, and more importantly, the ability to demonstrate reasoning through problems, points of contention, or suggestions for improvement. It is important to hold the state of the program in your mind and incorporate new information in real time, articulating how this incorporation is happening. This requires preparation and knowing how to get into that mindset.</li>\n<li>Most tech companies are looking for engineers that are collaborative, engaged and independent. Understand how that can be expressed through your work experience. Prepare a summary of work experiences that demonstrate such qualities. In this case, I had rambled honestly, but perhaps rather incoherently. </li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/notes-for-job-apps","tagSlugs":["/tag/jobs/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-06-15T02:37:40.310Z","description":"Just some distilled notes on job interviews, and how to potentially improve.
