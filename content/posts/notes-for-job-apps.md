Here's just some notes that are really for me. Job interviewing can be a gruelling, but ultimately perfectable, process, I believe. 
# Ada 
I interviewed with Ada recently, but was not given an offer. The position was of an undeterminate type, and they were hiring for a general placement in their teams later. The interviews were segreggated into 3 segments; a technical interview, a collaborative interview, and an interview with the hiring manager. 
 
According to my own personal post-interview review, as well as feedback from the recruiter, Tristan, who had reached out to me, my technical interview was weak and the other (more social/personality-based) interviewers indicated that I didn't fit their criteria well. 

Some points to take away:
1. The interviewers are looking for some prerequisite technical knowledge, but also, and more importantly, the ability to demonstrate reasoning through problems, points of contention, or suggestions for improvement. It is important to hold the state of the program in your mind and incorporate new information in real time, articulating how this incorporation is happening. This requires preparation and knowing how to get into that mindset.

2. Most tech companies are looking for engineers that are collaborative, engaged and independent. Understand how that can be expressed through your work experience. Prepare a summary of work experiences that demonstrate such qualities. In this case, I had rambled honestly, but perhaps rather incoherently. 


# Karat - First Pass 
_10-JUL-2021_

I completed the first pass of Karat technical interview for a Wayfair technical position. I'm listing this under Karat since it's most probable that question formats will remain similar between technical interviews conducted by Karat (they are a third-party interviewing company that specializes in quantifying the interviewing process, it seems). 
## Part 1
This part consisted of 4 technical questions, time-limited to 5 minutes each. From my recollection this is the list of questions asked: 
1. Briefly describe an SQL query (or set of queries) that extract and update information from 2 tables that are linked by a common key.  
2. Given a pipeline of nodes that each specify some throughput value, determine the max throughput of the entire pipeline. 
3. For a given scenario, describe whether to use 'strong concurrency' or 'eventual concurrency'. 
4. Given a set of servers that each host a document, each of which can be edited concurrently by an indeterminate number of clients, and where documents are assigned to servers in a round-robin fashion, describe the potential problems in load-balancing at scale. 
 
I blanked a little while trying to grok the questions due to nervousness, but usually got a sense of what the solution should be as I talked through it. However, I don't think my solutions were entirely correct for 1, 2 and 3. I gather that these were meant more to be logical questions that try to determine the steps you took to arrive at your solution. 

I think I panic and thus blank for a period because of the new information, and I overwhelm myself in trying to speed read through the question. I must learn to stay calm, focus, read as slow as I have to. 

## Part 2 
This part consisted of coding questions, time-limited to 20 minutes each. Difficulty seems to range from Leetcode easy to medium. Again, they want an articulated solution before any code is written in-order to assess how you formulate and assess any potential solutions before implementation. This must be balanced primarily with a working solution, and secondarily with optimality and succinctness. 

I managed to get a working solution for the first question, was able to outline verbally a solution for the second question, but was not able to implement it in time. 

I think I ramble too much. Verbalizing your thoughts does not equate to articulating your solution. Exploration through the solution space is not necessarily what I want to do, especially since that consumes precious time. What I need to do is, pause, formulate a potential solution, and then concisely explain it, writing it down at the same time. I realize that I had trouble remembering the previous steps in the algo if I didn't write them down as points. Verbalize the high level algo, add bullet points that are useful for you. 

## Conclusion 
Still weak, need to grind more leetcode in the meantime. Have scheduled another attempt on July 18. Will update.
