# Motivation
I've made doing leetcode questions part of my daily routine, so here are just some of my thoughts as I progress from being a lowly easy-only problem solver to someone more advanced. Generally, I keep my total time to solve under 20 min, and I can currently do 70% easy problems within that timeframe. Once 20 min has elapsed, I step out of rushed mode and transition to a more exploratory relaxed problem solving mode, or just look at the solution. Once that's done, I leave the problem blank so I can come back it again later. 

# The problem 
The objective here is to formalize the process of solving problems (at least leetcode problems, for now) form a cognitive perspective. When I previously solved these problems, it was mostly an instinctual process, without much adherence to a specific timeframe or set of steps. I'd formulate an end-to-end solution and then immediately start writing code. 

The problem with this approach, and I think that this is unique to me, is that there's a mixing of the problems of implementation and that of the algorithm itself, both of which, while important, are distinct stages. There's a need to slow down and reason the algorithm out as far as possible, ironing out the kinks there, and then moving onward to implementation issues, such as off-by-one issues.
