I am an senior full-stack developer working at [Touchbistro](https://www.touchbistro.com/). I'm currently working on different projects for the company, some of which might've been posted here somewhere.

While I'm not working on company time, I'm generally working on school projects and assignments for the Georgia Tech OMSCS program (Online Masters in Science for Computer Science).
