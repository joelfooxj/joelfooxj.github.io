I am a developer working at [Kinetica](https://kineticadynamics.com/). I wear many hats, solving problems for my team and working on projects that prepare our IT and compute environments. 

While I'm not working on company time, I'm generally working on school projects and assignments for the Georgia Tech OMSCS program (Online Masters in Science for Computer Science)
